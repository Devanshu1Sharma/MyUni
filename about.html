      <h2>With the aim of <b>HELPING OUR COMMUNITY,</b></h2><br>
      <p>This website was introduced on <b>10th April 2024</b> to help the students in their academics by providing them <b>all study resources(notes, books, practical work, assignments, practice questions, previous year papers)</b> at one place thus relieving the hassle of searching here and there for study materials.<br>With our broader vision, we have helped students with the best of our capability in every manner.<br> 
<br><br><b>MyUni Resources</b> will transcend the limitations of being just a mere society and instead rise to become a truly worthy and exceptional organization, leaving an indelible mark on all those who have the privilege of being a part of it.
